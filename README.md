## Objective:

This blog may contain some raw and unfiltered thoughts. I do try to  refine and present my ideas as succinct as I can, but forgive me if I  fail in doing so. The pages of this blog contain topics ranging from:

- Administration

- Data Science

- Programming

- Computer Security

- Web Development

- Personal/Opinions

  

## Tools I used:

This blog is written in Jekyll and is using the default Minima theme. I have overridden the main.css file to alter the theme.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
