<img class="image-left" src="/assets/images/personal/time.jpg">This week at **XL Design Professionals** (XLDP), I only worked 8.5 hours because I took some time off to devote some time for paper works involving school. My work place is aware that I am applying for the masters program at CSUMB. Last week, my supervisor and his two business analysts discussed how I should help create some documentation of the workflows that I am slowly getting accustomed to. This was necessary in case I plan to progress my role within the company. I had been introducing some more efficient processes that I learned fresh from school and they want others to benefit from it. I was more than willing to share my knowledge.

Most of the things that I do are technical in nature and someone else needs to learn how to do some of these tasks like:

1. manage backup tapes to be delivered to our data center
2. monitor and support XL Design Professional Policy Issues mailbox
3. monitor and support XL Microsoft Helpdesk issues
4. administer migration/connection between data/reports from various databases that are essential to office procedures and some administrative tasks that can be requested irregularly.

From the time I stated, I was asked to document these procedures and in my absence, I made these documents/instructions public so someone else in the office will be able to do them when I am not around. 

The long term projects that I finished include:

1. make over of an extranet website
2. a programming project that will meet the following Security Requirements for password validation that is described in the “Identification and Authentication Standards – QM6015GBL Version 2.1” of FIC (Framework Internal Control) requirements:
* Administrator accounts or supervisor accounts must be 12 characters passwords.
* Never be the same as the User ID
* Not contain more than two consecutive, identical characters.

A programming project that I started satisfies the same requirement as above but involves creation of additional fields and tables to an extranet application database.

The challenges I have is to be patient when you do not have the right access or privilege to do something. I am always anxious to get the job done but I know that it is not possible especially if you are working with teams. I learned that every technical or non-technical procedure in a developing company should be accounted for.

I learned the value of formal documentation of procedured in the office. I also had a taste of how to be meticulous and detail-oriented when dealing with audits. Overall, even as a mere intern, I need to adhere and be familiar with the company's business standards and requirements.
