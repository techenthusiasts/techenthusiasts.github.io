Big data acts as *Decision Support System* (DSS)

Scenario: A bank trying to optimize the price of insurance in order to maximize profit. Resources for Big Data include

* Repository
* Web Activity
* Transaction
* Competitors Pricing
* Social Media 
* Third Party Statistics

Current: Limitation of Data Warehousing

* Data is sampled, cleaned,
* It can have only limited attributes
* It cannot process the data in huge amount
* Data warehouse has a predefined static schema 

Future: Big Data acts as a Digital Nervous System

* What is important and what is not
* Learning from experience
* Adapting to changes 
* Reacting swiftly
