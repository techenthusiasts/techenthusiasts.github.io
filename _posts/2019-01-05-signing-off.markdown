Signing off...

I am awake as the vampire sleeps
typing my life into pieces and seams
waiting for time to stop and recover
maybe love doesnt hurt as much there.

I deny a world enslaved by
a symbol just don't ask Y;
countless time-munching rooms
a labyrinth without any broom.

Take me out of this mess,
I am sure this is just a test
of how i could lift a hand...
and feel the warmth of real sand.

I will breathe.
Eat my need.
Away from you.
Dreaded Yahoo.
